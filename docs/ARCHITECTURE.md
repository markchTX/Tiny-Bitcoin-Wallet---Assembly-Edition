# Tiny Bitcoin Wallet Architecture

This is a very simple, assembly-based Bitcoin wallet. It includes basic functionality like private key generation, public key derivation, and raw transaction creation.

## Features
- Private key generation (genkey.sh)
- Public key derivation (genaddress.sh)
- Raw transaction creation (sendtx.sh)

## TODO
- Add real ECDSA signature support
- Implement base58 address encoding
- Add basic error handling
